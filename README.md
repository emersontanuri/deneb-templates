# Coded Deneb Templates

This project provides templates for DENEB/Vega-Lite charts for Power BI and a helper script to parse Coded JSON to valid JSON.

## Templates for DENEB/Vega-Lite Charts for Power BI

The project includes templates for various types of charts, such as line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, and more. These templates are pre-built and can be easily customized to create visually appealing charts in Power BI.

## Helper Script for Parsing Coded JSON to Valid JSON

The helper script included in this project allows you to parse coded and commented JSON files into valid JSON.
